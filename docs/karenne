Things that worked well
-----------------------
* The mentors were very helpful and patient with hackers of all levels of experience
* The Django for Designers tutorial is a great alternative/supplement to the Official Django Tutorial
* It was great to meet and be encouraged by fellow learners!


Things that I had questions about
---------------------------------
* Conceptually, how to plan/structure an app in the Django framework - e.g. I want to create an app that does X, in what order do I build things in Django?  Presumably, start with a model, build a view, then a url and template?
* Frequently there is a one-to-one-to-one relationship between views, templates, and urls, what are exceptions to this?
